# Command Shell Program

## Summary:

This program attempts to recreate a command shell with a handful of basic executable commands. These commands include: `echo`, `cd`, `ls`, `mkdir`. The user is capable of inputting a command along with an argument, and the program should output a proper response. Not only this, commands can be linked together with a number of "connectors," (`&&`, `||`, `;`) each with their own functionality.


- `&&` - executes the following command if the previous command succeeds
- `||` - executes the following command if the previous command fails
- `;` - executes the following command regardless of whether or not the previous command has failed or succeeded


## Known Bugs:
- There have been issues with the exit call sometimes not ending program correctly

## Note from the author:
As of the current state of the Command Shell Program, it is limited in its functionality. **HOWEVER** we have planned and designed it in such a way that allows for additional functionality to be implemented as we are given feedback in the future.
